u've become addicted to the latest craze in collectible card games, PokeCraft: The Gathering. You've mastered the rules! You've crafted balanced, offensive, and defensive decks! You argue the merits of various cards on Internet forums! You compete in tournaments! And now, as they just announced their huge new set of cards coming in the year 2010, you've decided you'd like to collect every last one of them! Fortunately, the one remaining sane part of your brain is wondering: how much will this cost?


There are C kinds of card in the coming set. The cards are going to be sold in "booster packs", each of which contains N cards of different kinds. There are many possible combinations for a booster pack where no card is repeated. When you pay for one pack, you will get any of the possible combinations with equal probability. You buy packs one by one, until you own all the C kinds. What is the expected (average) number of booster packs you will need to buy?

Input :

The first line of input gives the number of cases, T. T test cases follow, each consisting of a line containing C and N.

Output :

For each test case, output one line in the form
E

where E is the expected number of booster packs you will need to buy. Any answer with a relative or absolute error at most 10-5 will be accepted.

Limits
1 =< T <= 100

Small dataset
1 <= N <= C =< 10

Large dataset
1 <= N <= C =< 40

Sample :

Input 
2
2 1
3 2

Output

3.0000000
2.5000000

<br/>
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.<br/>
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of A. The next N lines contain N space-separated integers A[i]1, A[i]2, ..., A[i]N denoting the i-th row of matrix A.<br/>
It's guaranteed that A is symmetric.<br/>
Output<br/>

For each test case, output a single line containing N integers - vector y, described in the statement, if there is a solution, or -1, if there is not. In case there are several solutions, print any solution.<br/>
Constraints and Subtasks<br/>

0 ≤ Aij ≤ 1<br/>
Subtask 1: (15 points)<br/>
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000<br/>
1 ≤ N ≤ 10<br/>
Subtask 2: (25 points)<br/>
1 ≤ T ≤ 500<br/>
1 ≤ N ≤ 20<br/>
Subtask 3: (60 points)<br/>
1 ≤ T ≤ 100<br/>
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000<br/>
The sum of N2 over all test cases in one test file does not exceed 106<br/>
Example<br/>

Input:<br/>
3<br/>
4<br/>
0 0 0 1<br/>
0 0 0 1<br/>
0 0 0 0<br/>
1 1 0 0<br/>
4<br/>
1 0 0 1<br/>
0 1 0 1<br/>
0 0 0 0<br/>
1 1 0 0<br/>
2<br/>
0 0<br/>
0 0<br/>
Output:<br/>
0 0 1 1<br/>
-1<br/>
0 1<br/>
Explanation<br/>
<br/>
Example case 1.<br/>
Matrix which is determined by vector y is<br/>
0 0 1 1<br/>
0 0 1 1<br/>
1 1 0 0<br/>
1 1 0 0<br/>
<br/>
Then A → X = ¬ O and X → A is<br/>
1 1 0 1<br/>
1 1 0 1<br/>
0 0 1 1<br/>
1 1 1 1<br/>
Example case 2.<br/>
A11 = 1 and X11 = y1 xor y1 = 0. So A11 → X11 = 0 and condition A → X = ¬ O can not be satisfied.<br/>
